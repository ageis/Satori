##Satori

###Distributed, tamper-resistant circumvention tools

An unfiltered internet is critical to free speech and self-determination -- the most precious of liberties. Free flow of ideas is particularly crucial in areas with intense internet filtering, as these are the areas pushing oppressive policies onto their people.

What Satori does is provide access to verifiable bundles of privacy-enhancing software to those who need it most.

**Note:** I need people who use a language other than English to help test.

###Features
* language detection to offer the right download
* distributed downloads, with options on Github, Amazon, and the Chrome Web Store itself
* SHA256sum checker to help verify software integrity

##Danger! High Voltage!!
This software is currently ***alpha***.
